class SpanFormat:
    """A description of a tag format.

    The anatomy of a tag is ``{token-function}-{span-type}``. It has two parts, the second part
    is the type of the span. This is specific to the downstream task and can be things like
    ``PER`` or ``LOC`` for NER or things like ``to_city`` and ``from_city`` for slot filling used in a
    dialogue manager for air travel booking. The first part is the token function. It is generic
    across tasks and it is used when converting per-token labels into spans. Common examples is
    when a tag starts with a ``B-`` we know that it is the beginning of a new span or when a tag
    starts with ``I-`` we know that is is inside of a span.

    Note:
        Some tag formats have special ``end`` and ``single`` values for tags that end a span and
        tags that constitute a whole span in themselves while others don't. The span encoding
        formats that don't have end and single tokens just repeats of the ``inside`` and ``begin``
        attributes respectively.

    not following (touching) another span of the same type it would be an ``I-``. So the value of the
    BEGIN tag isn't known without context. The same applies to the SINGLE tag. When a span is a single
    token the prefix will be ``I-`` if it is preceded by no span, or a span of a different type. It
    would use the prefix ``B-`` if the previous span was that same type.
