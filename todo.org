* Encoding Schemes [6/6]
  - [X] iob
  - [X] bio (iob2)
  - [X] iobes
  - [X] bilou
  - [X] bmewo
  - [X] Enum of the types

* to spans code [1/3]
  - [ ] extensive testing (with Hypothesis?)
  - [X] Use a NamedTuple `Span(type: str, start: int, end: int, tokens:
    List[int])`
  - [ ] Programmatic access to errors

* Conversions [10/10]
  - [X] iob ↔ bio
  - [X] iob ↔ iobes
  - [X] iob ↔ bilou
  - [X] iob ↔ bmeow
  - [X] bio ↔ iobes
  - [X] bio ↔ bilou
  - [X] bio ↔ bmeow
  - [X] bilou ↔ iobes
  - [X] bilou ↔ bmeow
  - [X] iobes ↔ bmeow

* TODO Testing [0/2]
  - [ ] Conversions
  - [ ] parsing

* TODO Documentation [0/2]
  - [ ] Docstrings
  - [ ] Read the docs

* TODO (Short) Paper at NLPOSS-2020 [0/2] <2020-07-01 Wed>
  - [ ] Use it to find bugs in released tagging datasets
  - [ ] Write the paper lol
  * The main Idea is that this is a vetted and well tested library
    for processing and evaluating span based task
  * Highlight places where I used it to find bugs in published work
  * Examples of using it to process spans at Work, Use the robust parser
    to create spans and operate on those instead of actually looking at the
    token level tags
